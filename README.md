# linkgem
LinkGem is a very basic bookmark manager. It allows you to organise your favourite website links through folders. Bookmarks can be saved in a JSON format.

Currently there are no ways to import and export bookmarks from other browser. This project is meant to be a prototype bookmark manager written to learn more about Java and JavaFX.

This project was written for a final school summative.
